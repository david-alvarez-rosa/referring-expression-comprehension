* Thesis

A PDF version can be found at [[https://recomprehension.com/Thesis.pdf]].

To compile this document the first time, all the images must be downloaded
(since they are not in version control). To do this, download them manually
from [[https://recomprehension.com/Thesis/Figures/Images/]] or execute the
following command (from the =Thesis= directory),
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  wget --recursive \
       --no-parent \
       --no-directories \
       --directory-prefix=Figures/Images/ \
       https://recomprehension.com/Thesis/Figures/Images/
#+END_SRC

Then compile with,
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pdflatex -shell-escape Thesis.tex
  biber Thesis
  makeglossaries Thesis
  pdflatex -shell-escape Thesis.tex
  pdflatex -shell-escape Thesis.tex
#+END_SRC

*Note* It will take a long time to compile for the first time (as you will be
 externalizing figures). From then on compile time will be drastically reduced
 (you can always use =\includeonly{}= when editing).
