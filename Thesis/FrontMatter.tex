\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my very deep appreciation to Professor Sanja Fidler, my
research supervisor, for her willingness to host me as a visiting student at her
research group, as well as for her enthusiastic direction and useful critiques
of this present work. I would also like to thank the University of Toronto for
making this stay possible and Vector Institute for providing me with all
computational resources and amenities to comfortably carry out the entirety of
the project. I would also like to acknowledge Professor Xavier Giró for
mentoring my project from Barcelona.

My special thanks are extended to Professor Miguel Ángel Barja, Professor Toni
Pascual and Professor Eduardo Alarcón, respectively director, mobility director
and deputy director of the Interdisciplinary Higher Education Centre (CFIS), for
their excellent work in the management of this Mobility Program, which has
facilitated me the opportunity to be hosted in one of the most cutting-edge
research institutions of the world.

I wish to acknowledge the help provided by Professor Fidler students Hang Chu
and Wenzheng Chen, for their countless observations and useful contributions to
this work, as well as to Jordi Fortuny, Rafel Palliser, Dídac Surís and Louis
Clergue, fellow students from Polytechnic University of Catalonia that have
supported me during the whole project, and which whom I have the pleasure to
share a very good friendship. I am particularly grateful to my dear friend and
housemate Jordi Fortuny for his endless patience and comprehension throughout
the whole stay.

I cannot forget to mention and acknowledge my secondary school teachers Antonio
García and David Pi, for putting so much effort to make me discover and realize
the intuition and beauty of mathematics.

Lastly, I need to thank my family for their incessant support and affection
through my education, even when very long distance has separated us, and
especially my sister for always being an inspiration for me with her limitless
strength and creativity.
