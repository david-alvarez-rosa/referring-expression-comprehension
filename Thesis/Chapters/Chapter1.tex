\drop Artificial Intelligence (\acs{ai}) is one of the topics related to
\gls{cs} that are most current\footnote{On \today, current date of the
  document.} in recent years. It has gained great importance mainly due to its
applications in industry and everyday world, such as autonomous driving.

It is an area of research in which, curiously, there is no precise definition
universally accepted by the community of researchers and developers who work
every day in the field of \gls{ai}. \myCite{nilsson09:quest_artif_intel},
however, provides a useful definition:
\begin{quoteBox}
  Artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to making machines
  intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to
  function appropriately and with foresight in its environment.
  \tcblower{}Nils J. Nilsson
\end{quoteBox}

Within the larger world of \gls{ai} is \gls{dl} (which is part of a larger
scope called \gls{ml}). \gls{dl} consists of learning from data with the use of
deep neural networks. This data can be of a different nature: images, text,
audio, video, etc. This thesis will mix three of these media (audio
\(\rightarrow\) text and image), so it will form part of the area known as
\emph{multimodal learning}. Next in \vref{sec:description} the work of this
thesis will be described: \gls{rec}.%

\section{Description and Motivation}\label{sec:description}

\gls{rec} is the task of, given a linguistic phrase (\gls{re}) and an image,
generate binary masks for the object which the phrase refers to. This type of
task is framed within the field of multimodal learning: at the intersection
between computer vision and \gls{nlp}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{.32\textwidth}
    \centering
    \caption{Man with cap.}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Man with cap.jpg}
  \end{subfigure}\hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{.32\textwidth}
    \centering
    \caption{Laptop on the right.}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Laptop on the right.jpg}
  \end{subfigure}\hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{.32\textwidth}
    \centering
    \caption{Army officer white suit.}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/Army officer.jpg}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption[Examples of \glsentrylong{rec}]{Examples of \acl{rec}. Como se puede
    ver, podemos referirnos a objetos de la imagen con \gls{re} en lenguaje
    natural y se produce la segmentaci√≥n. Figures created by the author
    (all).}\label{fig:demo}
\end{figure}

In \vref{fig:demo} we can see some examples of this type of task. As we can
see, the input will consist of two entities: one \gls{re} and an image. The
model will be in charge of generating the segmentation of the object to which
the phrase refers. We see that the \gls{re} shown are different types: relation
of the object to segment with \emph{other object} (\re{man with a cap}), type
of object + relative \emph{positioning} (\re{laptop on the right}) and object
description + \emph{color} distinctive (\re{army officer white suit}).

Optionally this task can be exploited and expanded in various ways. Among them,
expanding the input and output set that the model can obtain.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Input.} We can propose more general models that are capable
  of understanding \gls{re} from audio, without having to enter the phrase
  manually. Likewise, the model can be expanded accepting in addition to
  images, videos. In this thesis we will work on the part of \emph{audio}.
  \item \textbf{Output.} The output can also be extended by generating, in
  addition to the binary mask of the segmentation, a bounding box.
\end{itemize}

This work will add a great facility mainly in the human-computer interaction,
so it is of great practical interest. Different applications of this model will
be discussed in \vref{sec:aplicaciones}.


\subsection{Objectives}

This research thesis has different different objectives. The first one is to
learn the operation of \gls{ai}, without any prior knowledge. Mainly in the
area of \gls{dl}, which is where the presented model fits. It is essential to
know the fundamentals of neural models to be able to understand in depth how it
is possible to solve the problem of \gls{rec}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Model.} Search for a model that performs well in \gls{rec},
  study its operation and try to improve it.
  \item \textbf{Visualization.} Present an interactive web interface in which
  the results of the work are presented. Here it will be vital that the model
  works fast enough.
  \item \textbf{Academic.} Write this report and present the work.
  \item \textbf{TODO.} Write this report and present the work.  Write this
  report and present the work.  Write this report and present the work.  Write
  this report and present the work.
  \item \textbf{TODO.} Write this report and present the work.  Write this
  report and present the work.  Write this report and present the work.
\end{itemize}

To achieve these goals, many other intermediate goals have had to be
achieved. Among them, reading, understanding and analyzing the results of
State-of-the-art models in recent literature. In addition, it has been
necessary to improve programming skills and learn new programming languages,
both for the development of the model in Pytorch, and for the development of
the web interface: frontend with HTML, CSS, JS and backend with PHP and Python.



\section{Applications}\label{sec:aplicaciones}

The use of \gls{rec} can have applications of various kinds. In recent years,
robotics and home automation are gaining great importance. This work enhances
the interaction between human and robot/computer. For example, it could make it
easier for a machine to understand commands from a human.

\subsubsection{Theoretical}

The creation and study of models in the field of multimodal
learning\index{Multimodal!learning} using deep learning can end up having
applications in different fields. Knowledge transfer between fields in \gls{ai}
is typical: many times \gls{cv} and \gls{nlp} end up sharing similar
techniques.

In this specific case, we have precisely the interaction between models for
language and for vision. This could be useful in the development of new models
in the future in the field of multimodal learning\index{Multimodal!learning}.

\subsubsection{Industry}

In the industrial field, the model presented here could have applications in
various fields. They could facilitate the interaction between operator/machine,
thus improving the efficiency of a certain company and optimizing processes.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{Images/Robots.png}
  \caption[Robots in automobile factory]{Robots in operation within an
    automobile factory. These processes are usually completely automated and
    controlled in real time. From
    \captioncite{online21:china_no}.}\label{fig:robots}
\end{figure}

Among them could be that of the automotive world, as shown in
\vref{fig:robots}, where several robotic arms operate on a vehicle being
manufactured. Being able to refer to objects/parts of the vehicle using
linguistic phrases would be very useful. For example, an operator could
visually see that one of the welds is badly made and order the robotic arm to
redo it with a \gls{re} of the type: \re{lower right front door weld}.

\begin{remarkBox}
  For some, there may be concern about whether this type of artificial
  intelligence applications could be detrimental to the professional future of
  society as a whole. It's an open debate, but, in the words of
  \citeauthor*{contributor18:artif_intel_will_replac_tasks_not_jobs}
  \cite{contributor18:artif_intel_will_replac_tasks_not_jobs},
  ``\textit{Artificial Intelligence Will Replace Tasks, Not Jobs}''.
\end{remarkBox}

This is just one example of the many applications that these models could have
in the industry. The vast majority of sectors could benefit from the
implementation of interaction systems between their operators and their
machines by means of voice and using \gls{re}.

\subsubsection{Domotics and \glsentryshort{iot}}

In the world of domotics and \gls{iot}, so fashionable today, the topic that
concerns this thesis could also be useful. Mainly for the ease it adds to the
interaction between machines and humans.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{.55\textwidth}
    \centering
    \caption{Cubes of different colors.}
    \includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{Images/Robot.jpg}
  \end{subfigure}\hfill
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{.4\textwidth}
    \centering
    \caption{Food and medications.}
    \includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{Images/Robot2.jpg}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption[Examples of applications in robotics]{Examples of applications in
    robotics. They can facilitate many interactions and tasks of day to
    day. From \captioncite{limited21:china_arduin_robot_arm} (left) and from
    \captioncite{iam21:futur_mater_handl} (right).}\label{fig:robot}
\end{figure}

In \vref{fig:robot} we can see some examples in which interaction in day-to-day
tasks could be facilitated. In this figure, a robot is seen taking cubes of
different colors and another robotic arm taking food and medicine from a shelf
and stacking the selected ones in a box.

Not only because of the ease that this could add to the lives of many people,
but also because of the added interest it would bring to people with
disabilities. For example, a person with some type of physical disability (or
an elderly person), might need help choosing products in a supermarket. In this
case, a robotic arm could help him, and this work would serve as a link between
the two and facilitate interaction. The person could refer to the products they
want to purchase by simply using their voice and referring to it in
\emph{natural} language.

\subsubsection{Security}

Another possible application would be that used by the police to control road
safety. In \vref{fig:dgt} we can see one of these drones.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{Images/Drone.jpg}
  \caption[Drones employed for road safety]{Image of one of the drones that can
    be employed by the authorities in order to guarantee road safety.}
  \label{fig:dgt}
  \source{TODO}
\end{figure}

This type of drones could incorporate systems such as the one presented in this
final degree project to be able to track vehicles using voice commands. For
example, syntactic structures composed of action and \gls{re} could be used,
such as the following.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Actions.} Different actions could be desired to control and
  guarantee road safety such as: follow, record, speed up, etc.
  \item \textbf{\gls*{re}.} It would correspond to linguistic phrases that
  identify the vehicle to be studied or the offender to be pursued: blue/
  black/red/\ldots car, large truck, sports car, van on the right, etc.
\end{itemize}

In this way, combinations such as: ``speed up the black car'' or ``record the
sports car'' could help control road safety. This work, as has already been
commented previously, focuses on \gls{rec} and not on the use made of this
comprehension after.
